Navigation in Flutter is the process of managing transitions between different screens or routes in an application, ensuring a seamless and intuitive user experience. Flutter provides a flexible navigation system, primarily using the Navigator widget and its stack-based architecture, which allows developers to push and pop routes (or screens) as needed.

The Navigator works like a stack of pages, where new screens are added to the top of the stack using Navigator.push() and removed with Navigator.pop(). For simpler navigation needs, Flutter offers named routes, allowing developers to define and organize routes in a central place for easier access and readability. For more complex applications, packages like go_router and auto_route simplify navigation and offer advanced features such as deep linking, nested navigation, and URL-based routing for web compatibility.

Flutterâ€™s navigation system also supports animations between transitions, customizable back-button behavior, and state management integrations, ensuring a smooth user journey across platforms. Whether for small apps or large-scale, multi-page applications, Flutter's navigation tools are designed to provide developers with robust and adaptable solutions.
