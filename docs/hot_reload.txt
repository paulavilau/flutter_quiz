Hot reload is one of Flutter’s most powerful and time-saving features, allowing developers to instantly see the results of code changes in their running application without restarting it or losing the current state. This functionality significantly speeds up the development process by enabling quick iterations, making it easier to test new ideas, fix bugs, and tweak UI designs in real time.

When a code change is made, Flutter’s hot reload injects the updated source code into the running Dart Virtual Machine (VM), and the framework automatically rebuilds the widget tree to reflect the modifications. This seamless workflow is especially useful during UI development, as developers can experiment with layouts, animations, and styles while immediately seeing the outcomes.

Unlike traditional development cycles that require app restarts and navigating back to the testing state, hot reload preserves the current app state, enhancing productivity and creativity. This feature, combined with Flutter's other developer-friendly tools, makes it a favorite among developers for building modern, cross-platform applications.
